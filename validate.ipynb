    "Python has a variety of methods that will examine a given string and check that it represents a valid number. <br /> ```isdigit(), isnumeric()``` and ```isdecimal()``` are a few examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a new, more general function that will check if a string is a proper number of any type, i.e., integer, decimal or rational.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know if a given string represents a valid number? Let's start with the integers. The first question to ask is whether or not all the characters in the string are numbers, that is, are they in the set '0123456789'? What about negative numbers? Well, is there a minus sign in the string? We'll need to add '-' to our set so we can check and we now have '-0123456789'.  Further, if there is a minus sign, is there only one and is it at the beginning of our string? Answering these will let us know if our string represents an integer. This can be accomplished in a few lines of Python with a functional programming technique known as reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "A reduction is a higher-order function that uses a combining function to return a single value from a list or set of values. In our example our set will be a string of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reduction that operates over a simple set or list can be built with a for loop. In the code below, the first loop checks that all characters are in the set '-0123456789'. The second loop checks that if there is a minus sign, it is the first character only; or, said more explicitly, all characters except the first are not '-'. If both of these are true, we will have a string that represents an integer. \n"
